# FSD-demo

## Overview
This repository provides tools for loading and visualizing simulation example data of Forming Simulation Dataset (FSD). The code is designed to handle the unstructured simulation data, with support for common scientific data formats and flexible visualization options.

## Features
​​- Data Loading​​: Supports loading simulation data from ZIP formats
​​- Visualization​​: full-field multiphysics with different time steps

## Examples
- Example data is provided in 'ExpSimuRes.zip'
- Data loading and visualization is realized by 'main.py'
- The visualization result of this example is presented in 'Visual_full_field.pdf'
