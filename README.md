# FSD-demo

# Overview
This repository provides tools for loading and visualizing simulation example data. The code is designed to handle structured and unstructured simulation data, with support for common scientific data formats and flexible visualization options.

# Features
​​Data Loading​​: Supports loading simulation data from various formats (CSV, NPY, HDF5, etc.)
​​Data Processing​​: Includes basic data cleaning and normalization
​​Visualization​​: Multiple plotting options for 1D, 2D, and 3D data
​​Interactive Exploration​​: Jupyter notebook support for interactive data analysis

# Examples
Example datasets are provided in the examples/ directory:

thermal_simulation.h5 - 3D thermal diffusion
fluid_flow.csv - Unstructured CFD results
particle_trajectories/ - Time series particle data
